# Cabin Sketch
by Pablo Impallari

The Cabin Font is a humanist sans inspired by Edward Johnston’s and Eric Gill’s typefaces, with a touch of modernism.

Cabin incorporates modern proportions, optical adjustments, and some elements of the geometric sans.

This is the Sketch version, with the texture of a teenage doodle.
